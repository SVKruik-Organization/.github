## SVKruik-Organization

[![Release Broadcast](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/Discord-Bots/actions/workflows/broadcast.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=release)](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/Discord-Bots/actions/workflows/broadcast.yml)

Welcome to the `SVKruik-Organization`, a repository created to streamline the whole Discord Bot project. This organization features a wide variety of sub-projects featuring their own techstack, while still being closely connected to eachother.

This organization features several key repositories:
- [Discord Bots](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/Discord-Bots): the repository for the bots.
- [Bot Commander](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/Bot-Commander): a advanced configuration interface for the bots.
- Website: a planned website to invite the Bots to your server and to download the Bot Commander application.

Altough there is a lot going on, this organization is still a one-man operation. If you would like to contribute, do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:sv.kruik@gmail.com?subject=SVKruik%20Organization%20Contributing&body=Please%20specify%20in%20what%20part%20of%20the%20infrastructure%20you%20would%20like%20to%20contribute.%0A%0AOr%20just%20ask%20for%20my%20other%20modes%20of%20communication%2C%20and%20we%20can%20link!)!
